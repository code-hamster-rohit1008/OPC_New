                    <p>Users must be at least 18 years old and legally competent to contract. Corporate Users must have
                        authority to bind the entity. Users must register using accurate information, promptly update
                        changes, and submit KYC documents if requested. OPC may refuse, verify, suspend, or terminate
                        accounts that are incomplete, fraudulent, or breach these Terms.</p>
                    <p><strong>KYC & Verification:</strong> OPC may require identity, business registration, tax, or
                        bank details for Brands/Sponsors or Influencers. Provision of KYC documents is a condition of

                    <h3>4.1 Facilitator Role</h3>
                    <p>OPC provides an online marketplace and facilitation services that connect Influencers, Brands,
                        and Sponsors. Unless expressly agreed otherwise in a written, signed contract, OPC acts only as
                        an intermediary and is not the employer, agent, joint venture partner, fiduciary, or legal
                        representative of any User.</p>
                    <p>Contracts for campaigns, sponsorships, or events are formed directly between the contracting
                        Users (Brand ↔ Influencer, Brand ↔ Sponsor, etc.). OPC’s role is limited to facilitation,
                        technology, and optional administrative services (e.g., payments, escrow, analytics). This
                        intermediary role is central to OPC’s legal protections under Indian law.</p>
                    <h3>4.2 Services Offered</h3>
                    <p>Matching, proposal & negotiation support, templated contracts, invoicing/payment facilitation,
                        escrow (where offered), campaign monitoring & analytics, dispute support, event & sponsor
                        coordination, and related services.</p>

                    <p>Users are solely responsible for account credentials; notify OPC immediately of unauthorized use.
                        OPC may disable or suspend accounts for suspicious activity, lawful requests, or to comply with
                        regulatory obligations (KYC, tax reporting, court orders).</p>
                    <p>For payment facilitation, Users must provide bank/SWIFT/UPI details and tax identifiers (GSTIN,
                        PAN) where required. OPC may share limited KYC/tax info with payment processors or authorities

                    <h3>7.1 Contract Formation</h3>
                    <p>Campaigns and collaborations are governed by the separate agreement executed between the
                        contracting parties (the “Campaign Agreement”). Where OPC provides a templated agreement, that
                        template is a starting point; parties should customize terms (deliverables, timelines, payment
                        milestones, IP licenses, approval processes, performance KPIs, penalties/bonuses,
                        confidentiality).
                    </p>
                    <h3>7.2 Payment Facilitation & Escrow</h3>
                    <p>If OPC provides payment processing/escrow, OPC will hold funds only as a custodian and will
                        release them per the Campaign Agreement or these Terms. OPC may charge service fees/commissions;
                        these are disclosed at onboarding and prior to transaction. OPC is not liable for losses caused
                        by third-party payment processors beyond OPC’s gross negligence or willful misconduct.</p>
                    <h3>7.3 Refunds & Disputes</h3>
                    <p>Refund/chargeback policies are governed by the Campaign Agreement and OPC’s payment policy. OPC
                        acts as a neutral facilitator in disputes but does not itself decide payment outcomes except
                        where escrow rules apply or where required by law.</p>

                    <p>OPC processes personal data in accordance with the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 and
                        applicable rules. OPC acts as a Data Fiduciary for data collected through its Platform, and will

                        basis. Users must ensure they obtain appropriate consents for personal data processed in
                        campaign activities (e.g., audience data, contests).</p>
                    <h3>10.2 User Obligations</h3>
                    <p>Users shall not upload or require sensitive personal data unless strictly necessary and lawful.
                        Users must obtain consents where required and must not ask for another person’s personal data
                        without consent.</p>

                    <p>OPC maintains industry-standard technical and organizational security measures. However, OPC does

                        circumstances will OPC be liable for indirect, incidental, special, punitive or consequential
                        damages, including lost profits, loss of data, or business interruption.</p>
                    <h3>12.3 Safe Harbour & Intermediary Protections</h3>
                    <p>OPC will rely on applicable intermediary safe-harbour protections (e.g., Section 79 of the IT Act
                        and rules) where applicable if OPC (a) acts as a mere intermediary, (b) complies with
                        due-diligence obligations, and (c) follows takedown and grievance procedures. Users acknowledge
                        that where these protections apply, OPC may not be directly liable for third-party Content but
                        may still be required to act on notices or orders.</p>
